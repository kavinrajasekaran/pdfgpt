# PDFGPT - PDF Text Extraction & Summarization Tool

PDFGPT is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload a PDF file, extract text from it using Tesseract OCR, and summarize the extracted text using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. This project demonstrates how to integrate OCR, text preprocessing, and natural language processing into a single pipeline.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Upload a PDF file to extract text from its pages.
- Enhanced OCR accuracy using OpenCV preprocessing.
- Summarization of extracted text using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-turbo model (Updated from the deprecated text-davinci-003).
- Displays both extracted text and summarized text via a user-friendly web interface.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Flask
- pdf2image
- pytesseract
- opencv-python-headless
- numpy
- openai
- pillow
- Tesseract-OCR (installed via Homebrew)
- Poppler (installed via Homebrew)
